This project explores how modern computer vision techniques use images from smartphones, drones, and fixed cameras analyzed by deep learning to detect early signs of disease in crops. Methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning will be discussed, focusing on how they identify color, texture, and shape variations. The tutorial will address challenges such as dataset diversity, real-time field deployment, and the adaptation to a wide range of crops. The discussion closes with trends in AI-powered farming and future research directions in sustainable agriculture.</p>\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\"><strong>Table of contents:</strong></p>\n<ol class=\"marker:text-quiet list-decimal\">\n<li class=\"py-0 my-0 prose-p:pt-0 prose-p:mb-2 prose-p:my-0 [&amp;>p]:pt-0 [&amp;>p]:mb-2 [&amp;>p]:my-0\">\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\">Introduction and Motivation (loss reduction in agriculture)</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"py-0 my-0 prose-p:pt-0 prose-p:mb-2 prose-p:my-0 [&amp;>p]:pt-0 [&amp;>p]:mb-2 [&amp;>p]:my-0\">\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\">Sensor Modalities (smartphones, drones, hyperspectral cameras)</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"py-0 my-0 prose-p:pt-0 prose-p:mb-2 prose-p:my-0 [&amp;>p]:pt-0 [&amp;>p]:mb-2 [&amp;>p]:my-0\">\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\">Classical and Deep Learning Approaches (preprocessing, transfer learning, CNNs)</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"py-0 my-0 prose-p:pt-0 prose-p:mb-2 prose-p:my-0 [&amp;>p]:pt-0 [&amp;>p]:mb-2 [&amp;>p]:my-0\">\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\">Successes &amp; Failures (field studies, generalization, cloud-based prediction)</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"py-0 my-0 prose-p:pt-0 prose-p:mb-2 prose-p:my-0 [&amp;>p]:pt-0 [&amp;>p]:mb-2 [&amp;>p]:my-0\">\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\">Challenges (dataset bias, weather, scalability)</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"py-0 my-0 prose-p:pt-0 prose-p:mb-2 prose-p:my-0 [&amp;>p]:pt-0 [&amp;>p]:mb-2 [&amp;>p]:my-0\">\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\">The Future &amp; Conclusions (smart farms, policy, research labs)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\"><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"marker:text-quiet list-disc\">\n<li class=\"py-0 my-0 prose-p:pt-0 prose-p:mb-2 prose-p:my-0 [&amp;>p]:pt-0 [&amp;>p]:mb-2 [&amp;>p]:my-0\">\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\"><a class=\"inline_disabled\" title=\"Link\" href=\"https://imagevision.ai/blog/plant-disease-detection-using-computer-vision-for-early-diagnosis-and-prevention/\" target=\"_blank\">Plant Disease Detection Using Computer Vision - imagevision.ai</a><span class=\"citation inline\" data-state=\"closed\" aria-label=\"Plant Disease Detection Using Computer Vision in Agriculture\"><a class=\"inline\" href=\"https://imagevision.ai/blog/plant-disease-detection-using-computer-vision-for-early-diagnosis-and-prevention/\" target=\"_blank\"></a></span></p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"py-0 my-0 prose-p:pt-0 prose-p:mb-2 prose-p:my-0 [&amp;>p]:pt-0 [&amp;>p]:mb-2 [&amp;>p]:my-0\">\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\"><a class=\"inline_disabled\" title=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.meegle.com/en_us/topics/computer-vision/computer-vision-for-plant-disease-detection\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Vision For Plant Disease Detection - meegle.com</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
