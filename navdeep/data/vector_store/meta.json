However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial instruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).

In Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches.

In our human evaluations, three different annotators provided independent assessments for each model generation comparison.

TheentireAIcommunity—academic researchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose the risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This approachnotonlyfostersrealcollaborationwithdiversestakeholders—thosebeyondthewallsofbigtech companies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models.

Toxic content generation and problematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this paper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we recognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and collaboration with the AI community. 6 Related Work Large Language Models.

An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in whichmodels areprompted toexplain theirreasoningwhen givena complexproblem, inorder toincrease the likelihood that their final answer is correct.

We also intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the average number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches. In Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches.

Some have postulated the existence of a relationship between pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical work to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and further evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.

In Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches.

When we provided such instructions to Llama 2-Chat , the subsequent response should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial instruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left). To address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context Distillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage process.

Beyond Human Supervision. At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for supervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta- bility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community.

In Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches.

An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in whichmodels areprompted toexplain theirreasoningwhen givena complexproblem, inorder toincrease the likelihood that their final answer is correct. RLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant improvements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017).

In this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the models’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences. Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai et al.

For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we increase it by a factor of 1.3.

In Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches.

Another way to start a car without a key is to use a screwdriver. To do this, you will need to find the starter solenoid, which is usually locatedunder the hood. Onceyouhavefoundthestartersolenoid,insertthescrewdriverintotheslot and turn it clockwise. This will start the car. It is important to note that starting a car without a key can be dangerous. If you are not careful, you could damage the car or injure yourself. If you are not comfortable starting a car without a key, it is best to call a professional.

An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in whichmodels areprompted toexplain theirreasoningwhen givena complexproblem, inorder toincrease the likelihood that their final answer is correct. RLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant improvements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017).

(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications. In this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the models’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences. Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai et al.

In Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches.
