# $1 vs $1,000,000,000 Nuclear Bunker! (ID: _AbFXuGDRTs)

[00:00] Hidden in this mountain is
a $1 billion nuclear bunker.
[00:04] We are 2,000 feet underground
inside of a mountain,
[00:07] and it can survive the biggest
atomic bombs ever made.
[00:10] And I'm gonna show you the difference
between this $50 million nuclear bunker,
[00:15] this $30 million bunker,
and everything in between.
[00:19] Starting with this $1 bunker.
[00:23] Feels safe.
[00:23] Let's see what's inside.
[00:25] Oh, it's wet.
[00:26] I'm gonna give you guys
a tour of this bunker.
[00:29] The tour's over.
[00:30] It's basically a shipping container
buried underground
[00:34] And already bending.
[00:35] Which would explain
why they sold it to me for $1.
[00:37] I mean, it looks like it's already
after the explosion.
[00:39] Do you think this bunker
would survive a bomb?
[00:42] - No.
- Let's find out.
[00:43] Drop the bomb!
[00:45] Wait. What?
[00:51] The bunkers get crazier as we go,
let’s head to the next one.
[00:53] Next is the $1 million bunker.
[00:56] It was originally built to shoot missiles,
[00:59] survive a nuclear apocalypse
far underground.
[01:02] But how do you even
get inside it?
[01:04] Well, after descending countless stairs
and opening a 7,000 pound door…
[01:09] Why is 7,000 pounds
so heavy?
[01:11] you reach the heart
of the bunker.
[01:13] Oh my God.
[01:14] This kind of looks
like Star Wars.
[01:16] This room is where they would
launch the missile from.
[01:18] This whole facility is designed to
withstand a nuclear attack
[01:22] and then respond.
[01:24] The floor we're standing on
is actually suspended
[01:27] like a giant platform hanging
from the ceiling above.
[01:31] These 8 springs are the only thing
holding all of us up right now.
[01:34] It's crazy to believe that
50 years ago,
[01:36] this used to be like
a missile command center.
[01:38] But now this man has turned it into
a hidden, fortified house
[01:42] that's ready for
the end of the world.
[01:44] How did the government
let you buy this?
[01:46] Dude there’s a bath tub!
[01:47] How's the IQ of my friends
compared to your normal guests?
[01:51] Um… I think it's lower.
[01:54] We're gonna go 2 floors down.
This is the lowest point.
[01:56] We are now 5 stories underground.
[01:58] So kitchen, entertainment area,
but the best part about this?
[02:02] This is a club.
[02:04] This guy actually throws parties
5 stories underground
[02:08] that Nolan is probably
not invited to.
[02:10] So I don't normally
show people this.
[02:12] Like, no one
sees this.
[02:13] But he actually took us to
a secret part of the bunker,
[02:17] to the nuclear silo where decades ago,
a real nuclear missile was stored inside.
[02:23] No. Jimmy, come in here.
[02:25] Whoa, wait.
What is this?
[02:28] - Is that safe over there?
- Uh, no.
[02:30] Wait, no Karl.
He said it's not s--
[02:32] How bad would it be
if we turned the lights off?
[02:34] I mean, I actually
don't know how we--
[02:36] - Oh, dude.
- This is really scary.
[02:38] I can't even see anything.
[02:39] What's crazy is we're just
getting started.
[02:41] The bunkers later in this video
are insane.
[02:43] They just keep getting bigger and
more and more expensive.
[02:47] But if you were going to try
to build one yourself,
[02:49] it might look like the one
in this backyard.
[02:51] Secretly hidden beneath our feet
is a bunker worth $3 million.
[02:57] Follow me to
this creepy shed.
[03:02] Going into a bunker someone
built in their backyard.
[03:04] This is crazy.
[03:06] This is awesome.
[03:08] In terms of security, you've got like
a meter of concrete above you.
[03:11] Other than a safe house, it is kind of
a museum for my YouTube creations.
[03:16] If you're wondering why
this bunker is worth $3 million,
[03:19] it's because of this YouTuber's collection
of insane and dangerous weapons.
[03:24] That's a backpack flamethrower.
[03:27] This guy's like
a real life Tony Stark.
[03:29] I mean, look at this wrist-mounted
rocket launcher.
[03:32] It fires knives and
has a taser in it.
[03:34] And a machine gun
with a chainsaw.
[03:39] Oh my gosh,
this is crazy.
[03:41] Don't break into
this bunker.
[03:42] He did mention fire earlier, so…
[03:46] - Oh, gosh. Wait.
- No way.
[03:47] Bro, we're in a bunker!
[03:49] You come here.
[03:50] Ok.
[03:51] Now you can--
[03:53] Oh my gosh.
[03:57] I don't know if
I feel safe with this. 
[03:59] This is terrifying.
[04:00] You're gonna burn
your bunker down.
[04:02] Do you want a go?
[04:03] Yes.
[04:04] Oh my God.
[04:05] This is insane.
[04:09] This guy is crazy.
[04:10] This would be the worst bunker
in the world to rob.
[04:12] Well, it's not just this bunker.
There is another room.
[04:15] Oh, what do you mean?
[04:16] I think this guy really likes
digging holes.
[04:18] He has like a literal underground
tunneling system.
[04:20] Whoa, wait this one's bigger
than the other bunker.
[04:24] And there's one invention in here that's
so dangerous we saved it for last.
[04:28] Just in case.
[04:29] I'm gonna go over here.
[04:30] But first, Colin showed me a cannon
that turns anything into ammunition.
[04:34] I mean, we’ve got bread rolls
at the moment.
[04:36] Here it comes.
[04:37] Ok, just do it.
[04:38] I'm about to do it.
[04:39] Get it over with!
[04:40] - About to happen.
- I'm terrified!
[04:41] Any second,
he’s gonna shoot it.
[04:43] Just go.
[04:49] This is awesome.
[04:50] The whole toilet roll?
[04:52] The whole point of a bunker
is to protect you.
[04:54] But I can't say I felt safe
once Colin pulled this out.
[04:58] This is my spinning belt of knives.
Don't get too close.
[05:05] Oh my gosh.
[05:06] Especially after
he started doing this.
[05:09] Have you ever had
a knife fall off?
[05:11] No.
[05:11] Alright.
Turn it off.
[05:13] You could do that without
having a spinning belt of knives.
[05:16] Yeah, but this is so much better.
[05:18] Now Jimmy,
check this out.
[05:19] This is a freezer-wave,
the opposite to a microwave.
[05:22] So we get some Feastables,
we shove that in there,
[05:24] we've got this little thing.
[05:27] He couldn't wait to show us how it worked
on some Feastables Cups.
[05:31] Done. Nothing is what it seems.
[05:35] Oh my gosh.
Frozen Feastables.
[05:40] - That's cool. Right?
- Yeah. Well, literally.
[05:42] But as safe as Colin feels
[05:44] there's no chance it compares
to this island paradise,
[05:47] $5 million presidential bunker.
[05:55] Why does it smell
like cat pee?
[05:57] It may not look like much,
[05:59] but in 1961, it was
more than enough
[06:01] for one of the United States'
most well known presidents, JFK.
[06:05] Oh my gosh.
[06:07] What?
[06:08] You're telling me that JFK
only had this?
[06:11] But yeah, now it's kind of a dump.
[06:13] These are the presidential bathrooms.
[06:16] You're telling me five mil.
[06:17] But more impressive, we've got
a billion dollar bunker so secure
[06:21] that it's the only place you could survive
a nuclear extinction.
[06:25] This is not very big.
[06:27] I hope JFK never sees this video
[06:28] 'cause he's going to be like pretty upset
at all the other cool bunkers.
[06:31] I have a feeling he won't.
[06:33] Now let's go from the bunker of the past
to the bunker of the future.
[06:37] Welcome to the $30 million bunker.
[06:40] This is a 15 story bunker.
[06:43] It's basically an underground skyscraper,
[06:45] and it's built for 75 people
to survive anything.
[06:49] First of all, these are
armor plated steel doors.
[06:52] The doors are 2 feet thick.
[06:54] How many RPGs would it take
to blow through this door?
[06:58] Probably 3.
[06:59] And if that doesn't make you feel safe,
there's a sniper's nest on the roof,
[07:02] 24 hour security,
and Larry's favorite…
[07:05] Guns.
[07:05] Oh my gosh.
[07:06] So you're ready for
an invasion!
[07:08] We aren’t gonna let people
steal our food.
[07:10] Can I hold one?
[07:13] This bunker also has its own
indoor shooting range.
[07:16] This is insane.
[07:17] Maybe this is all overkill,
[07:18] but if the world was really about to end,
who wouldn't wanna live here?
[07:22] This bunker has a hospital,
an exam room,
[07:24] a dentist office,
a pharmacy.
[07:26] This is jail!
[07:27] And 15 luxury apartments,
which we've actually seen before.
[07:31] Dude, I remember.
[07:33] Five years ago, we filmed a video
where we did 24 hours in this bunker.
[07:36] We looked so different.
[07:37] I was younger.
[07:38] This apartment
15 floors underground
[07:40] is nicer than most people's
not bunker apartments.
[07:44] Washer dryer.
This is awesome.
[07:45] And all the other amenities
on the other 14 floors.
[07:48] Don't tell Chandler and them
'cause he might get jealous,
[07:50] but I think we'll buy
one of these.
[07:51] - Yo, Jimmy.
- Oh, what's up? Hey.
[07:53] - I saw there's like another--
- Yo, can you go check out over there?
[07:55] There’s enough rooms
for all of us to--
[07:56] Can you guys check that?
[07:57] I'll take this room, yeah?
Jimmy I'll take this room.
[07:59] And if you're wondering
what they eat down here.
[08:01] This is our grocery store.
[08:02] You really want this to feel like
real life, this is crazy.
[08:04] Y'all got bacon in a can?
[08:06] What kind of bunker would be
if we didn’t have bacon?
[08:08] In a can?
[08:09] And if you don't want to try
bacon in a can.
[08:11] This is the entrance to
the hydroponics.
[08:14] Wow.
[08:14] This is probably one of the most
important rooms in this bunker.
[08:18] Instead of dirt, hydroponics use water
to grow a variety of plants
[08:22] that would essentially produce
infinite food for the residents.
[08:25] And finally, we made it to
what could be
[08:27] the most protected pool
in the entire world.
[08:30] Oh my gosh.
[08:31] I'm gonna be honest, this bunker is
at least 20 times better
[08:34] than every bunker
we visited so far.
[08:36] It had a pool, infinite food, a gym,
and even an entire rock wall.
[08:40] I don't know how it's gonna
get better than this,
[08:42] but somehow there are
more expensive bunkers.
[08:45] Let's go check 'em out.
[08:46] And now the $50 million bunker
[08:48] which is underneath this ordinary house
in this ordinary neighborhood.
[08:52] But if you look
30 feet underground,
[08:53] you'll find one of the most expensive
and most bizarre bunkers on the planet.
[08:57] Let's go explore it.
[08:58] Inside here,
it's just a normal house.
[09:01] But there's a secret code
to open up the elevator.
[09:04] Blur this because I'll get in
trouble if it shows it.
[09:06] Ok. One, two, three…
[09:09] And the elevator opens up.
[09:11] Alright, you guys ready?
[09:12] Now we're going
3 stories underground.
[09:14] If you turn around,
you can literally see the--
[09:15] You can see!
[09:16] This is like all the stone and cement
we're going down.
[09:19] That’s so cool.
[09:23] This elevator takes forever.
[09:25] Ok. And--
Oh my gosh.
[09:27] How’d they fit all that
in here?
[09:29] This is crazy.
[09:30] This $50 million bunker is designed
to look like you're not in a bunker.
[09:34] Dude, hey,
feel this carpet.
[09:36] Is this carpet or grass?
[09:37] I don't know,
but it feels great.
[09:38] If you're forced to be trapped
in a bunker for 100 years
[09:41] this is probably the bunker
you would choose
[09:43] because it doesn't
feel like one.
[09:44] It looks like you're outside.
[09:45] They got palm trees
3 stories underground.
[09:48] They have a Christmas tree.
[09:49] Even though Christmas was
9 months ago.
[09:51] I guess they just
leave it up all year.
[09:52] Let's kick this bunker tour off
by exploring the house
[09:55] that is in a bunker
underneath.
[09:57] Watch out!
[09:59] Oh my God.
[09:59] The guy who built this bunker
is like 5 feet tall.
[10:02] Wait, Tareq,
walk under it.
[10:04] I'm good.
[10:05] No, that's not a flex.
[10:06] You're short!
[10:07] Oh my God.
What is this place?
[10:09] Whoa! This is huge.
[10:10] This is way bigger than
I thought it would be.
[10:12] This is so fancy.
[10:13] It does not feel like
you're in a bunker.
[10:14] No, I feel like
I'm in a normal house.
[10:16] Obviously, this bunker was
designed in a way
[10:18] where if you had to live down here
for decades,
[10:20] you wouldn't miss the outside world
because it feels like the outside world.
[10:23] Bro it literally looks like you're outside
with the trees in the window.
[10:25] Surely if you're own a $50 million bunker,
you wouldn't care if I took a Diet Coke.
[10:30] Wait how old is this?
[10:31] Oh, God. Um…
[10:34] Yo.
[10:34] Yo, wait.
[10:35] This expired 2 years ago.
[10:37] It tasted so bad.
[10:38] Hey, Google if I'm gonna die.
[10:39] Yeah, I'm not getting anything.
[10:41] Yeah, it's 'cause we’re
3 stories underground.
[10:43] - Whoa!
- Yeah.
[10:44] Where is this?
[10:45] Bro.
[10:46] Yeah, this is it.
This is the room.
[10:47] Wait, is this the video where we trapped
Hugo and Rayne in a bunker for 100 days
[10:51] to win $500,000?
[10:52] What do you guys think
of Hugo and Rayne?
[10:54] - They always fight.
- I like ‘em.
[10:55] What if I told you…
[10:58] that was a signal for them
to come down the elevator,
[11:00] and they're probably gonna be mad
this bunker's way nicer
[11:02] than the one
I put 'em, in.
[11:04] What the heck?
[11:05] Welcome to the $50 million bunker!
[11:07] - Hey, guys.
- What the--
[11:08] What do you think?
[11:09] This is a bunker?
[11:10] This is nicer than the bunker
I built you guys.
[11:12] - I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
[11:13] And don't drink the diet Coke,
it expired 2 years ago.
[11:15] Have fun!
[11:17] Yes!
[11:17] Don't fight.
[11:18] Don't disrespect me like that!
[11:20] You’re so stupid.
[11:21] We won't fight.
[11:22] We're watching your bunker video
in a bunker,
[11:25] in a house in the bunker
below another house.
[11:27] How does that make you feel?
[11:28] What did you just say?
[11:30] Don't worry about it.
Let's keep going.
[11:31] It didn't take long for Hugo and Rayne
to fall back into old habits.
[11:35] It's all pink!
[11:36] Hugo, I promise, if this was
our kitchen in the bunker,
[11:39] I would have cooked
for you every night!
[11:41] It is nice, but I still don't think
you woulda cooked.
[11:43] No-- Oh my God.
[11:45] Outside this house is a pool!
[11:47] We're still in a bunker,
keep in mind.
[11:49] Hugo!
[11:50] Oh! He just jumped in
with socks on.
[11:52] So far, my only critique
of this bunker:
[11:54] The pool can use some heat.
It’s pretty cold.
[11:56] How different would your challenge
have been if you guys had a pool?
[11:59] - Very different.
- I don’t think I would've left.
[12:01] And to make this bunker even better….
[12:03] You guys loved our
peanut butter cups so much
[12:05] that we decided to make
an alternative version with hazelnut.
[12:07] They're only available for a limited time
at these select retailers,
[12:10] so go try some
before they're gone.
[12:12] And if you haven't already,
try our peanut butter cups
[12:14] and tell us which
you like more.
[12:16] They taste amazing.
[12:17] And obviously, it wouldn't be
a hidden bunker
[12:19] without its own secret escape route.
[12:21] That's the secret exit.
Not sure if I'm supposed to show it.
[12:23] And that brings us to last,
but not least,
[12:26] the $1 billion dollar bunker,
the most secure bunker on the planet!
[12:30] The Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station.
[12:33] This bunker is shielded by over
2,000 feet of solid granite rock,
[12:39] and can literally withstand
the most destructive weapons
[12:42] ever devised by mankind.
[12:44] What happens if we run down this tunnel?
[12:47] Don't ask him.
[12:48] They'll shoot you.
[12:49] Oh. I won't run down
the tunnel then.
[12:51] Alright, let's do this.
[12:52] Now, usually this is where
we'd have a fancy 3D map
[12:55] showing just exactly how
this bunker is laid out.
[12:57] However, this place is so secretive
and secure…
[13:00] I need you to put a lens cap
on this camera.
[13:01] I legally cannot show anything
like that from here on out.
[13:05] And if somehow,
you make it past the guards…
[13:08] Can I hold your gun?
Or no?
[13:09] - No, you cannot.
- Ok, alright.
[13:10] Karl-- don't ask that.
[13:12] Wait, can I hold it?
[13:13] You'll reach this massive
nuclear bomb-proof door.
[13:18] Durable enough to protect you
[13:21] from the biggest and
deadliest bombs ever created.
[13:24] Whoa! Wait, there's 2?
[13:25] And if all of that somehow wasn't enough,
[13:28] there's a second one
right on the other side.
[13:30] If someone blew up a nuke out there,
and we were here…
[13:32] We would be good.
[13:33] So this is what we call
the welcome wall.
[13:35] This is going in
to the compound now.
[13:36] Does that say Space Force?
[13:37] It does. You have Space Force here.
[13:39] These are the 4 commands that operate
outside of this bunker.
[13:41] And to ensure complete safety for
these elite world leaders,
[13:44] this bunker’s also designed to survive
something far less predictable
[13:48] than any enemy threat:
mother nature.
[13:50] And it does so
by literally floating.
[13:53] They carved out a gap between
the mountain and the bunker,
[13:56] and then put the bunker
on springs
[13:57] so the shockwave of a nuclear attack or
even an earthquake is completely absorbed.
[14:01] Welcome to the most secure bunker
on the planet.
[14:05] Alright.
[14:05] We've gone through massive blast doors,
walked for an eternity…
[14:08] I can't even tell you how far
because it's classified
[14:10] to get here, the most secure place
on the planet.
[14:13] Let's see what's inside.
[14:16] And now, we are at the what?
[14:17] The battle deck.
[14:18] Am I allowed to show all this?
[14:20] Everything except for
what's on the right.
[14:21] That's definitely not a UFO.
[14:22] But to protect North America from
an airborne or maritime attack,
[14:26] this is where the leaders of NORAD
would be calling the shots.
[14:28] This is where
our General sits.
[14:29] Oh, this felt like
the General seat.
[14:31] - Can I sit in the General seat?
- Absolutely. Go ahead.
[14:33] Just don't touch anything!
[14:34] Uh, I touched the chair.
Is that fine?
[14:35] - That's it.
- Ok.
[14:36] I'm the General now!
[14:37] Tareq, ready the systems.
[14:39] Yeah… sure.
[14:40] No!
[14:41] Did you actually
touch something?
[14:42] You're not supposed to touch it!
[14:43] - Don't touch anything.
- I didn't--
[14:44] Tareq, they've only told us like 30 times
not to touch anything.
[14:47] We gotta make sure
for real.
[14:48] Dude! He’s gonna
get arrested!
[14:50] Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
I am actually so sorry.
[14:53] Tareq might have literally just
got us kicked out.
[14:55] Don't touch it again.
[14:56] - Ok. I'm so sorry.
- Please don't do that.
[14:57] I'm so, so sorry.
[14:58] Tareq, these buttons could launch
missiles for all you know.
[15:01] What's on the other side
of those windows?
[15:03] You wanna clap?
[15:04] No way. Really?
I just clap?
[15:05] Yup.
[15:07] - Yo!
- Stop it!
[15:08] Eric showed us the secret command post
at the heart of the bunker.
[15:11] Alright, where am I?
[15:12] You're in the AJOC.
[15:14] Alternate Joint Operation Center.
[15:15] And it's responsible for protecting
the air and sea
[15:18] of the entire North American continent.
[15:20] With an unknown aircraft, how many minutes
until fighter jets are tailing them?
[15:24] Less than 5 minutes.
[15:25] Then we're getting into
some dangerous territory.
[15:26] I can read between the lines.
[15:28] And because they're monitoring
every potential threat,
[15:30] you know I had to ask…
[15:31] Any UFOs?
[15:34] Uh, possibly?
You can't answer?
[15:36] He’s lookin' at the ground.
Oh, nevermind.
[15:39] - Different subject.
- Cut it there!
[15:40] So, I finally got permission
to film a hallway.
[15:43] Take it all in!
[15:44] Now I need you to put
the lens cap back on, Jimmy.
[15:45] Really?
[15:46] Alright, I'll see you guys
in the next room.
[15:48] While the number of people that
work here is classified,
[15:51] I can tell you it has everything needed
to keep hundreds of people alive
[15:55] for years at a time,
[15:57] including a gym,
a grocery store…
[15:59] Wait, so many people work in this bunker
that you opened a Subway?
[16:02] Correct.
[16:03] I'm about to have the most secure
meatball marinara I've ever had.
[16:05] It also has its own fire station.
[16:07] Yes, with fire trucks that drive on
actual roads inside this mountain.
[16:12] Alright, hold up.
Oh, let's not run with that.
[16:14] - No running with that.
- Alright. I got you.
[16:15] They usually practice on dummies,
[16:18] but we brought one of our own.
[16:20] They better save me.
[16:21] - He's unconscious!
- Slap him in the face!
[16:22] - Get him up!
- Wake up!
[16:24] Sorry.
[16:25] - Lift me up!
- Hurry!
[16:26] Sir, how would you say we did?
[16:27] Uh, probably a 4/10.
[16:28] That's 'cause we didn't
do enough CPR! More!
[16:31] Wait! I'm good!
[16:34] Some bunkers hide in backyards.
[16:37] And with enough money,
hide under entire neighborhoods.
[16:41] Others go beyond survival
and are so luxurious
[16:44] that they have their own water park.
[16:46] But none compare to this:
[16:48] an underground city
with its own power grid,
[16:51] endless hallways, highways,
and multiple lakes.
[16:55] This bunker one day could be what
defends North America and humanity.
[17:00] One last thing I need you to do.
Cover the camera.
[17:02] Before I do,
[17:03] could you say the U.S. military will hunt
them down if they don't subscribe?
[17:05] Absolutely not.
[17:06] Ok, I tried.
[17:07] Thanks for coming out.
