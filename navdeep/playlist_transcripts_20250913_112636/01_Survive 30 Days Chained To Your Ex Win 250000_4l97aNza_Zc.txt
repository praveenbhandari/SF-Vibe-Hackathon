# Survive 30 Days Chained To Your Ex, Win $250,000 (ID: 4l97aNza_Zc)

[00:00] Take off your blindfolds!
[00:01] These two people used to date.
[00:03] They had a four-year romantic relationship
and now they're exes.
[00:07] And if they spend 30 days
chained together…
[00:10] I will give them $250,000.
[00:16] How long ago did
you two date?
[00:18] Three years ago.
[00:19] She broke up with me.
[00:20] He's salty.
[00:21] I can't force you guys to do it,
[00:22] but once you clip on the handcuffs,
the 30 day challenge has begun.
[00:26] I’m locked in.
[00:29] - Oh, gosh.
- They're both handcuffed.
[00:30] From this point forward,
[00:31] if either of you decide to quit
by crossing this red line,
[00:34] I will instantly unhandcuff
both of you.
[00:36] The video is over,
but neither of you wins anything.
[00:39] Have fun, you two.
[00:41] My ex-boyfriend?
Really, Jimmy?
[00:43] Bro, what?
[00:46] - What’s up, dude?
- Hi.
[00:48] Can I give you a-- Oh.
[00:49] Oh. Where are we?
[00:52] This is your happy home
for the next 30 days.
[00:54] This is the kitchen.
[00:55] You can hang out.
You can workout.
[00:57] You have separate beds.
[00:58] There's a question mark door,
we'll worry about that later.
[01:00] And most importantly,
you're probably wondering,
[01:03] since you two are handcuffed together,
how do you use the bathroom?
[01:06] Oh, no.
[01:07] Someone go in the bathroom.
[01:08] Stop it! I have to shower
with this on?
[01:10] Yeah, if you take it off at any point,
the video is over.
[01:13] Slide the handcuffs in there.
[01:13] Wait. You guys are cruel!
[01:15] Boom! Hey, she needs
more slack.
[01:16] But what if she has to use the toilet.
[01:19] Hey!
[01:20] Wait, I can't believe I'm in the same room
as you right now.
[01:22] - Yeah, and you're kinda stuck with me.
- Yeah.
[01:24] - Wait, am I stuck with you?
- Oh, gosh.
[01:26] Actually, Suzie has been through
this kind of challenge before
[01:29] when she lasted 100 days in a room
with a complete stranger.
[01:32] But this time, she's trapped
with someone she knows a little too well.
[01:36] One thing to decide,
[01:37] do we even wanna be
eating together?
[01:41] I don't know.
[01:45] Ok, Josh is showering right now
[01:46] so I feel like it's time to get
my honest thoughts out there.
[01:49] I'm nervous for this challenge.
[01:51] We dated four years.
We're broken up for three,
[01:54] and now we're locked
together in a box.
[01:56] At some point, someone's gonna
have to start saying something.
[02:05] Ay, ay, ay.
[02:07] - Jeez.
- Sorry.
[02:08] Well, you might as well
leave it on now.
[02:10] It's the morning of day two,
[02:11] and our exes are still trying
to find their own rhythm.
[02:14] You fed me. That equals happy woman.
[02:19] With this 60-foot chain,
they can live their own separate lives.
[02:22] And that's exactly what
they're choosing to do.
[02:24] I was picturing like if we were actually
chained close together
[02:27] and I was feeling
a little scared.
[02:29] Are you scared
to be close to me?
[02:30] She really should be.
Because this chain will shrink,
[02:33] and these two exes will be forced
to confront each other.
[02:37] Get me out of here!
[02:38] You make me wanna die.
[02:40] But for now, just living together
is proving to be pretty difficult.
[02:47] - You get wet?
- Uh, huh.
[02:49] Oh, sorry!
[02:50] With the disgusting pan grease
all over me.
[02:55] Sorry.
[02:57] On that note, I'm gonna go lock myself
away in the shower.
[03:00] Here's the deal.
[03:01] I've been pretty rough
on her today.
[03:03] She deserves it.
You broke up with me.
[03:05] I feel like we should talk
about our problems eventually.
[03:08] I want to acclimate a little bit more
before just yapping.
[03:13] It's been a few days
since we've seen Jimmy in here.
[03:15] I'm ready for some action
'cause right now, this is the vibe.
[03:20] Silence at all times.
[03:22] Things are so bad between them
[03:23] I wonder if a shorter chain
would bring them closer together,
[03:26] or tear them apart.
[03:28] It's day five,
and time for the first offer.
[03:30] Happy day five!
[03:31] Wait why are you guys
on opposite sides of the room?
[03:33] 'Cause we can be.
[03:34] Well, come on over.
[03:35] You're coming up on a week.
How's it been?
[03:37] It's just like, I'm getting kind of
used to her being here.
[03:39] It's hard to even like,
really talk about things.
[03:43] - Oh.
- Yeah.
[03:44] To celebrate five days
of being chained together,
[03:47] you're being served
a very special offer.
[03:49] Your chain is about to shrink
no matter what.
[03:52] Bro.
[03:53] Offer #1 is a 50 foot chain,
[03:56] 10 feet shorter than
what you currently have.
[03:58] - Mhm.
- Ok.
[03:59] Offer #2 is a 30 foot chain,
your current chain cut in half.
[04:04] And if you choose this one,
we will add $25,000 to your prize pool.
[04:08] If you guys wanna make $25,000
while sitting around in here
[04:12] then you would choose
this 30 foot chain.
[04:14] No, that's so short.
[04:16] If you choose this chain,
[04:17] you'll have to live a lot closer
to each other.
[04:19] I mean I was around you
for four years for free.
[04:22] I mean, I can be a little closer for--
[04:24] That's crazy.
[04:25] An extra 10K.
[04:27] Do you want your chain
cut in half?
[04:29] I'm saying yes.
[04:30] I'm with it.
Let's do it.
[04:31] Ok. Nolan, let's cut
the chain in half!
[04:34] Oh, gosh.
[04:35] Their chain has officially
been cut in half.
[04:37] Good luck
to the two of you.
[04:38] Cheers.
[04:40] I'm not regretful
of taking more money.
[04:43] Well we still have
25 days,
[04:44] but we also haven't really figured out
that this is shorter yet.
[04:47] Like, we haven't bumped into the issue
of it being too short yet.
[04:50] It'll probably happen
in a very short amount of time.
[04:54] Ohh!
[04:56] Like right now!
[04:57] Oh!
[04:58] Not even 24 hours into the chain
being half the length.
[05:01] We are already having problems.
[05:03] Even right now, Josh is showering
while I'm sitting at the table.
[05:07] I would love to be
on my bed right now,
[05:09] but the chain doesn't reach
the bed anymore.
[05:11] At 4 a.m. got woken up by Josh
to go to the bathroom.
[05:15] I need to go to the bathroom.
[05:16] [groans]
[05:19] The chain being shorter,
it's very uncomfortable in here.
[05:23] My God, 6 feet distance
at all times please.
[05:27] Ew!
[05:28] You just got your sweat
all over my forehead.
[05:33] Hey, I’m kind of walking!
[05:41] I’m Josh,
I'm immature.
[05:43] [mocking voice] My name is Suzie.
[05:45] You're looking pretty gross.
[05:46] Thanks!
[05:47] D-Bag.
[05:48] I think this challenge might be easier
if it was with a stranger.
[05:53] I know you're working on it.
I know you're trying your absolute best,
[05:56] but you're absolutely insane.
[05:58] [gasps]
[06:00] You're being disrespectful to me.
[06:01] - It's not disrespect.
- You're being mean.
[06:04] This morning I started with a comment,
and then we kept having an issue about it.
[06:08] To be real,
[06:09] the problem with the comment
was that you're like,
[06:12] making fun of me in hopes that
people would join in.
[06:15] To also point fun at me.
[06:17] Bro, you're actually delusional.
[06:25] Suzie in the psych ward.
[06:39] I really don't know how I'm gonna feel
about you at the end of this.
[06:42] It's been an absolute fiasco.
[06:44] It feels like she escalates it
when it's like,
[06:46] "No, no. Just a comment.
I'm not hating on you."
[06:50] - You know what’s crazy?
- You.
[06:55] Funny.
[06:57] Let's see if we go one day
without Josh pissing me off.
[07:01] Pardon?
[07:02] You keep saying things to embarrass me,
and I don't appreciate it.
[07:05] It's literally a joke.
[07:06] No, that's so embarrassing to do
to another person
[07:08] when who knows how many people
are watching us!
[07:10] Oh, like "that's disrespectful" thing
has turned it into a bit.
[07:13] I'm not thinking
in bits right now,
[07:15] I'm thinking in how I feel
I'm being treated.
[07:17] - Everything's about you.
- It's not.
[07:18] You're the star
and I'm the accessory.
[07:20] It's not all about me at all. It's--
we're equal partners.
[07:23] Josh is the one who did it.
Josh pissed me off. It's Josh's fault.
[07:26] Because I feel like you're saying things
that make me wanna die.
[07:35] I apologize,
it's totally understandable.
[07:38] But the only way that we're gonna
kill that now is to let that be yesterday.
[07:43] I wanna make it 30 days
and be done.
[07:45] I'm certain that you do as well.
[07:47] Yeah.
[07:51] This is more rough
than I thought it was gonna be.
[07:53] We're not gonna survive this
if it keeps going like today did.
[07:57] But I think we should try.
[07:58] Absolutely, I think we should try.
[08:00] We're just in here to survive, win money,
and then never speak again.
[08:11] Fresh start?
[08:15] Sure.
[08:16] And though they agreed to get along
for the sake of the challenge,
[08:20] I wanted to see just how committed
they were on the next check-in day.
[08:24] It's day 10!
[08:26] Yeah!
[08:27] To celebrate, we’re going to--
[08:29] Oh, no.
[08:30] Shrink your chain by 10 feet!
[08:32] - Woohoo!
- Yay!
[08:33] For free.
[08:35] Oh.
[08:36] But before we do that,
[08:37] obviously, shortening the chain last time
led to some personal space issues.
[08:41] [groans]
[08:42] And because in the future days,
[08:44] the two of you will have an opportunity
to make a lot of money,
[08:47] in exchange for shrinking your chain,
[08:49] for one time only,
I'm gonna unbolt the furniture,
[08:52] let you guys move it around,
and then bolt it back down permanently.
[08:55] Oh.
[08:57] But first, let's update your chain.
[08:58] Can't wait.
[09:01] And to help move things around…
[09:03] Alright, alright, alright!
[09:05] Here is your expert crew.
[09:06] Alright.
[09:10] You have until midnight tonight to move
whatever you want around.
[09:14] Should we get to it?
[09:15] Yeah, rotate, rotate, rotate.
[09:19] After putting the boys to work,
[09:20] Suzie and Josh moved all the furniture
within each area closer to each other,
[09:24] with an emphasis
on one area in particular.
[09:27] This is our bathroom and our bed.
[09:30] What we have tonight is what we will have
for 20 more days.
[09:33] It's survivable.
[09:34] And to sweeten the deal,
I gave them one more surprise.
[09:38] - Suzie, Josh.
- Chandler.
[09:39] We got a fridge full
of our brand new Feastables!
[09:42] - No way!
- Let’s go!
[09:45] Sorry, guys. This is our first time
revealing our chocolate milk.
[09:48] Oh! Cheers!
[09:49] Cheers.
[09:51] That's good.
[09:52] It's also made
with real whole milk
[09:54] and loaded with vitamins A, D,
and potassium.
[09:57] You took the words
right out of my mouth.
[09:58] It tastes amazing.
[09:59] Go find Feastables chocolate milk
[10:00] at Walmart, 7-Eleven,
and Speedway locations nationwide.
[10:03] This is the best part
of the whole challenge.
[10:08] Even though the chain got shorter,
[10:10] moving the furniture put Josh and Suzie
in a better mood.
[10:13] The chain shrunk 10 feet, and so far today
we haven't had any problems with it.
[10:17] Is there anything you're concerned about?
[10:18] Being too close.
[10:20] Ok.
[10:21] Even though their fighting continued,
[10:22] the chain was actually
starting to bring them closer.
[10:25] And over time,
they were becoming friends again.
[10:27] We're super bored today
and we've eaten a lot of Lunchly,
[10:30] so we're gonna put it up on the wall
in a heart shape.
[10:33] And now I present to you
the first Lunchly heart in the world.
[10:37] Josh wanted to lay down and journal
at the same time
[10:40] as I wanted to walk
on the treadmill.
[10:41] This is our compromise.
[10:42] Thank you, Josh.
[10:43] We should be working together
to get out of here.
[10:45] Yeah, we have to get through
everything.
[10:47] - Friends?
- Friends.
[10:49] But now that they were finally
getting along,
[10:50] Josh couldn't help but wonder,
[10:52] why didn't they work out
in the first place?
[10:55] Hey Suzie, can we talk?
[10:59] We didn't have a bad breakup.
[11:01] You wanted to go do other things
that didn't line up with what I was doing.
[11:04] Like, a reoccurring thing
in the past was,
[11:07] I felt as if I had to be sharing with you
what I wanted all the time.
[11:12] Honestly, I think if I were to
entertain something again…
[11:17] I would need to feel that it's like,
very different than before.
[11:22] What did you do after we broke up?
[11:25] Bawling my eyes out
because I was so alone.
[11:30] What’d you do when we broke up?
[11:33] I started crying.
[11:34] Like not following you but never
forgetting your Instagram handle.
[11:37] Searching it up every other week.
[11:39] But it was weird like watching your life
in third person
[11:42] after being a part of it
for so long.
[11:46] Felt like my heart split in two.
[11:52] Don't cry.
[12:00] I was still madly in love with you
when I broke up with you.
[12:06] I didn't want to break up.
I never wanted to do that.
[12:09] [chuckling]
[12:11] I don't think I ever like
fully stopped loving you.
[12:14] What?
[12:15] So what do we do?
[12:18] I feel like this challenge is allowing me
to see Josh in a whole new light.
[12:21] It has been…
[12:23] eye opening.
[12:25] The only problem is,
what happens in this room
[12:28] is not a good representation
of what life is in the real world.
[12:32] Even though Josh and Suzie were making
breakthroughs in their relationship,
[12:35] this was still a 30-day challenge,
[12:37] and the isolation from the outside world
was starting to get to Josh.
[12:40] Literally gave up my entire life
outside of here to be here.
[12:43] And it's just now really setting in.
[12:46] Bro, I haven’t been outside in two weeks.
My whole life is outside.
[12:49] If I had to pay to get outside access,
I would not do that.
[12:53] I just want to be outside, bro!
[12:55] What's up?
[12:56] I don't feel well. Mentally.
[12:57] And that's why on day 15,
[12:59] we had the perfect solution
to their biggest problem.
[13:02] For day 15, we wanted to offer you guys
an outdoor space.
[13:07] I'm giving you the chance to unlock
the outdoors and double your space.
[13:11] That means full access
to the entire yard whenever you want.
[13:14] But here's the catch:
[13:15] you guys wanna keep
this outdoor area,
[13:17] you're gonna have to switch
to a 10-foot chain.
[13:20] I've been missing the outside.
[13:21] We might have a better view
of like the sunset or even sunrise.
[13:25] Yeah but I don't think that's worth
losing half our chain.
[13:27] If we take this off
for just getting to go outside,
[13:30] we're always this close.
[13:31] We shouldn't do it, and we can easily
sacrifice not having sunlight.
[13:34] I just don't want it
to be a missed opportunity
[13:37] further down the line.
[13:39] I’m very tempted to take this.
[13:40] Ten feet halfway through
though means
[13:43] who knows how much
wiggle room we'll have, though?
[13:45] You guys have had time
to talk about it.
[13:47] Are you taking the day 15 offer?
[13:51] Yeah, no.
[13:53] Alright well, go back inside.
[13:55] We’re just gonna enjoy it
for one more minute.
[13:57] Yeah, there's a 10 second timer.
[13:58] - I'm up. I’m in, I’m in.
- 10, 9, 8, 7…
[14:01] 6-5-4-3-2-1!
[14:02] See ya in a few days.
[14:03] Alright. Do you feel regretful now that
we jumped inside?
[14:07] I don't know.
I do miss the outside.
[14:10] Turning down the day 15 offer
really took a toll on Josh.
[14:13] And the next day, the thought of
going outside was still eating at him.
[14:16] It’s a little bit, um, depressing today.
[14:19] You just woke up.
[14:20] Thinking it was Mystery Door and not.
[14:22] Having nothing change
about our daily life.
[14:24] This is the longest month of my life.
[14:27] The day that we were expecting something
big to happen, nothing happened.
[14:31] Why has today felt so long?
[14:34] Well hopefully the Mystery Door
whatever it is, it’s something good.
[14:38] Do you have any new thoughts
on what's in that room?
[14:40] Oh my gosh,
there's Teslas back there.
[14:42] That'd be crazy.
[14:43] Here's the thing,
this isn't the first time
[14:45] Suzie has faced
a mystery challenge.
[14:47] In a previous video,
she turned down a mystery box
[14:50] that had $50,000
and her favorite car, a Tesla.
[14:53] And it crushed her.
[14:54] Oh, I wanna cry.
That's literally my dream.
[14:57] They got us Teslas!
[14:59] If it's a Tesla behind those doors,
[15:01] we have to take it,
just for my redemption arc. Come on.
[15:04] But for Josh, the excitement
of the Mystery Door
[15:07] still wasn't enough
to bring him out of his funk.
[15:10] [groan]
[15:11] Feelin’ like I'm going crazy.
[15:14] Violence, bro.
[15:15] [grumbling]
[15:17] It's like, get me home!
[15:18] Josh was having
a hard time today,
[15:20] and sometimes you have to
be the one to continue
[15:22] pulling your partner along
when they're having a bad day.
[15:25] So Josh is still sleeping,
[15:27] but I decided to make him
breakfast this morning
[15:29] because Josh was just
feeling really down.
[15:32] For you!
[15:34] Whoa!
[15:35] You made a heart
out of bacon and eggs?
[15:37] Yeah.
[15:38] - Wow. A heart?
- Mhm.
[15:41] Friendship?
[15:43] Friendship.
[15:45] Part of me is wondering what that meant.
tryna figure that out.
[15:47] Like, you don’t just make someone
breakfast in bed.
[15:49] Josh was so confused and desperate
to understand Suzie's gesture
[15:53] that he did something so drastic,
so unthinkable.
[15:56] I mean, the one thing that he hated most
in the entire world…
[16:00] I guess I'm gonna have to read
“The Man's Guide to Women.”
[16:03] “When it comes to
the intricate dance
[16:04] that men and women do
when they're attracted to each other,
[16:07] the women are in control.
Their actions were often subtle.
[16:10] All were definitive signals that a woman
was interested and approachable.”
[16:14] While Josh was wondering
what was behind Suzie's act of kindness,
[16:17] Suzie was wondering
what was behind the Mystery Door.
[16:20] I can't see anything.
What if it's a little Tessy?
[16:23] Maybe we should make Jimmy
some banana bread.
[16:26] Good job.
I'm proud of you.
[16:28] Thanks.
[16:33] Thanks?
[16:34] - Bye.
- What?
[16:36] Can't wait for the chapter
of my “Men's Guide to Women”
[16:40] to explain what that was.
[16:41] The book says if she wants you,
these are the signals:
[16:44] Direct eye contact,
a smile,
[16:46] repeatedly glancing at you.
[16:48] Here's my guess…
[16:51] She likes me.
[16:56] Is that the ring from me?
[16:57] Yeah.
[16:58] You still wear it?
[16:59] Every once in a while.
[17:00] I never was able to throw away
a single thing from our relationship.
[17:05] One thing in particular,
I had to sell.
[17:07] What do you mean?
[17:08] The night before we leave here
is when I’ll tell you.
[17:12] I don't think I ever told her.
I was too scared.
[17:14] He kept most of the stuff
from when we dated,
[17:17] except something that he's been holding
from me this whole time.
[17:19] Let's just say there's a big reason
it's a secret.
[17:22] I gotta say,
I'm dying to know that secret.
[17:25] If there's anything keeping me here
‘til the end of this challenge,
[17:27] it's that information.
[17:29] It's day 20, and it's time
to spice things up a little bit.
[17:32] Happy day 20!
[17:34] How's it goin’?
[17:35] In front of you are five ways
you can open this Mystery Door.
[17:39] - Ooh!
- Oh my gosh.
[17:40] Now, here's the thing:
I'll be going from right to left,
[17:42] revealing an offer
under each platter.
[17:44] If you say yes to an offer,
[17:46] whatever's behind
the Mystery Door is yours.
[17:48] If you say no, only then
does the next offer get revealed.
[17:51] But just remember, you might be saying no
to the best deal on the table.
[17:55] Oh, that's messed up!
[17:57] Option #1, you pay $50,000.
[18:00] They hope that I take this one
'cause I'm all nervous.
[18:03] - What do you think?
- I think we say no to this.
[18:04] Ok.
[18:07] Offer #2, $100,000 out
of your prize pool.
[18:13] Ugh! It's probably the last platter
that's better.
[18:16] I think we get rid
of this again.
[18:18] The third offer…
[18:20] Ooh!
[18:21] Minus 25,000,
and your chain goes to 5 feet.
[18:24] This is how close you'll be.
[18:25] You still have 10 days left
in this challenge.
[18:27] Oh, God.
[18:28] Oh…
[18:28] If they say no,
they only have two offers left.
[18:30] Oh, this is hard!
[18:32] If they say yes, they will win
whatever's behind that question mark.
[18:35] Before you make a decision,
[18:36] do you remember
the last video you were in,
[18:38] where you said no to the mystery box
and a Tesla?
[18:41] Yep.
[18:41] What do you think
is behind that door?
[18:43] I have no idea.
[18:44] I can't see anything.
[18:45] Put your head on the ground.
[18:46] What if it's a little Tessy?
[18:49] I just wanna see the door!
[18:51] Let's take this…
for you.
[18:53] - Yes.
- Yeah, we'll take this one.
[18:55] Alright, they have officially
accepted the offer!
[18:57] My next offer was minus 25,000,
but your chain stays the same length.
[19:02] The final offer…
[19:03] Free. It's ok.
[19:05] They shrunk their chain to 5 feet,
they paid 25,000…
[19:11] What if they put two Teslas?
[19:12] Tesla, Tesla, Tesla…
[19:14] Teslas!
[19:18] You both won brand new Teslas!
[19:20] [screaming] Jimmy!!
[19:22] Come on in!
[19:25] I’m actually gonna cry!
[19:27] I know it's just a car,
but I’m actually so grateful!
[19:30] This is a $40,000 car.
[19:35] - Can I give you a hug?
- Of course.
[19:36] Oh, watch out for Josh.
[19:38] It's like a redemption arc!
[19:39] Exactly.
[19:40] I'm so excited!!
[19:42] She's excited.
[19:43] I'm excited because we just launched
our brand new creation for Feastables:
[19:47] Sour Strike Gummies!
[19:48] I literally can't believe this.
[19:50] Absolutely insane.
[19:51] They have no artificial dyes
or sweeteners.
[19:53] Just clean, high quality ingredients.
[19:56] I literally feel like I'm in a dream!
[19:58] Sour Strike Gummies
are now available
[20:00] at Target, 7-Eleven,
and Speedway locations nationwide.
[20:04] This is the best day
of my life!
[20:05] But don't forget these Teslas
do come at a cost.
[20:08] Let's see how the bathroom works
now that their chain is only 5 feet.
[20:11] Alright.
[20:12] Go to the shower.
[20:13] Alright.
[20:14] Oh!
[20:15] This chain can't get shorter.
[20:17] Oh… it can.
[20:21] We made you a Feastables banana bread.
[20:24] That actually looks good.
[20:25] I think the best way to wash this down
is with some Feastables chocolate milk
[20:29] now available in all these retailers
you see on screen.
[20:31] It tastes phenomenal.
Has 13 grams of protein.
[20:34] It’s in stores now.
Go try the new Feastables chocolate milk.
[20:36] I'll see you in 5 days
to shrink your chain again.
[20:38] - Great.
- Wow. Can’t wait.
[20:39] I look forward to it.
[20:41] Oh.
[20:41] See you guys.
[20:44] Good morning.
[20:45] Ok, gentle movements.
[20:49] I can't even wash my hands.
[20:50] Suzie and I have discovered
the fun reality that
[20:53] a 5 foot chain sucks.
[20:55] This chain is really annoying.
I can't even bring my hand up.
[20:58] Yeah it's pissing me off.
[20:59] [groaning]
[21:01] [groaning]
[21:03] Yeah, right.
You're gonna sit down.
[21:05] This 5-foot chain does not allow us to do
two different tasks at the same time.
[21:09] - Ow!
- Ah!
[21:10] [groaning]
[21:12] This is gonna get old real fast.
[21:14] - Hey!
- I need the chain!
[21:15] Bro!
[21:16] It doesn’t reach
in the shower.
[21:21] And that's my new reality.
[21:23] As he patiently waited
outside the bathroom,
[21:26] his mind wandered back
to the book.
[21:28] "Be a gentleman.
Pull out her chair…"
[21:30] Which inspired a change in his behavior
throughout the day.
[21:33] "Open doors. Put the woman
at the center of any conversation…"
[21:37] What's the name
of your car right now?
[21:38] It's Suzie.
[21:40] "Briefly touch her forearm
when you ask her to dance…
[21:43] "Ask open ended questions…"
[21:45] What the heck are we gonna do
when we get out of here?
[21:47] I don’t know.
[21:48] We're gonna wanna just be
handcuffed again.
[21:50] [laughing]
[21:51] But it was the final chapter that focused
on their key issue.
[21:55] If you don't plan a date
that makes her feel special and important.
[21:57] That's where I completely screwed
my entire relationship.
[22:01] I had to be sharing with you
the smallest of expectations.
[22:05] Like we haven't gone
on a date in 3 months.
[22:07] I didn't continue planning dates
that made her feel special and important,
[22:11] and I didn't pay attention
to what she wanted.
[22:14] I think she wants a date.
[22:16] So when Josh asked to speak to a producer
in private about a date,
[22:20] I knew I had to make it happen.
[22:23] Aw! You do look handsome.
[22:25] Yeah. You look really beautiful.
[22:27] Thanks.
[22:28] We got candles.
They got real candles.
[22:29] You did good. I gotta admit.
[22:31] Aw, this is so nice.
[22:33] Please have a seat.
[22:35] Thank you, sir.
[22:41] I kinda like this,
like being on a date.
[22:44] We are emotionally getting closer again.
[22:46] It’s true.
[22:47] I think it's scary 'cause
how it ended the first time.
[22:50] I think this is a step
in the right direction though.
[22:54] Can I take you on a real date
when we leave?
[22:56] Like, outside of here?
[22:57] Yeah.
[22:59] Yeah. I'd love to go on an actual date.
[23:02] Ok.
[23:04] Wanna cheers with
our Feastables chocolate milk?
[23:06] Cheers.
[23:08] To our MrBeast date.
[23:10] Yes.
[23:11] This has been a good time
to reconcile.
[23:14] Like is there makeup anywhere?
[23:16] Kind of figure out
the other person again.
[23:18] No.
[23:19] Hi.
[23:20] Hi.
[23:21] The idea of him intrigues me.
[23:23] I'm glad to just have a date
for the first time in 3 years.
[23:25] It was probably one of the most fun days
that we've had in here.
[23:28] Perfect end to our date.
[23:30] I'm feeling real nervous 'cause
I don't know what is gonna come next.
[23:35] It's day 25.
[23:37] Oh gosh.
[23:38] We're about to fundamentally change
this entire video
[23:41] and the change is
under this platter.
[23:43] Yeah, I hate this.
My heart is beating.
[23:45] Reveal what's under the platter.
[23:47] That's all you.
[23:49] I brought each of you the keys
to your handcuffs.
[23:52] Up until this point,
[23:54] unhandcuffing yourself meant
you'd both lose.
[23:57] And if at any point between now
and the end of the video
[24:00] you take your handcuff off,
[24:01] you actually get all $250,000
and both Teslas.
[24:06] [laughing]
[24:08] Grab your key.
[24:10] Grab your key.
[24:11] If you take your handcuff off,
you get everything
[24:13] and the other person gets $0.
[24:15] Are you gonna do it?
[24:17] I'm actually scared now.
I'm gonna always be on edge.
[24:20] I thought I was going to be like
a foot away from you.
[24:22] Oh and on top of this,
every single day going forward
[24:25] we are shrinking your chain
by a foot.
[24:27] Oh.
[24:28] Oh.
[24:29] On day 30, you two will be
this far apart.
[24:32] Oh, gosh.
[24:34] But you don't have to do that.
[24:36] Because now you can take the handcuffs off
at any point.
[24:40] That's crazy.
[24:41] This is wild, actually.
[24:42] You probably wanna know
what's truly going on in his mind.
[24:44] And you probably wanna know
what's truly going on in her mind.
[24:47] Bring in the lie detector.
[24:48] Are you kidding me?
[24:50] Nope. We brought in
a lie detecting professional.
[24:53] One of you might be
taking the handcuffs off.
[24:56] This is where the video gets fun.
[25:00] Josh, you are up first
in the hot seat.
[25:03] We combed through your vlog footage
and crafted questions
[25:06] that will really help her decide
[25:08] if she should stick it out in this video
or leave today.
[25:11] - Whenever you're ready.
- Ok.
[25:14] Have you ever doubted
my loyalty to you?
[25:19] No.
[25:20] Even though she broke up with you?
[25:23] No.
[25:27] True.
[25:29] Wow.
[25:30] He really trusts you.
[25:31] Whoa!
[25:33] Right.
[25:34] Brace yourself.
[25:35] Yeah, right.
[25:35] Since being here, have you thought
you might be better off single?
[25:40] No.
[25:42] - No?
- No.
[25:44] Really?
[25:45] - Oh, great.
- Uh oh.
[25:47] We're not giving you that one, buddy.
[25:48] That's literally a Mount Everest
on the graph.
[25:50] So it's a lie?
[25:53] It is a lie.
[25:54] Oh, ok.
[25:56] Let's keep going!
The questions get better as we go!
[25:59] Would you steal the entire $250,000?
[26:04] I don't think so.
[26:06] Yeah, you reacted a little bit
to that one.
[26:09] You wanna think about that one?
[26:11] Mmm.
[26:12] We just need a yes or no.
[26:15] No.
[26:16] Is he telling the truth?
[26:19] I wouldn't give it
to him completely. No.
[26:22] If there were no hard feelings…
[26:23] Of course there’d be hard feelings!
[26:25] Does that make you wanna
take your chain off?
[26:27] It makes me question it more.
[26:28] How do you feel now that
you got some hard hitting answers?
[26:31] Maybe a little bit scared.
[26:34] But then it was Josh's turn
to ask Suzie some questions.
[26:38] Josh, are you ready?
[26:41] I'm ready.
[26:44] Have you hidden something
from me you knew would hurt?
[26:50] Yeah.
[26:52] True.
[26:53] If you knew, like, how close I got
with someone else
[26:58] while we were not together.
[27:01] Ok. Something to talk about.
[27:03] I get a vibe you don't wanna talk
about it now?
[27:05] Nope.
[27:06] Ok.
[27:08] Next question.
[27:09] Do you believe that
I hold you back in any way?
[27:13] Yes.
[27:15] - True.
- The future outside of here…
[27:17] it's just hard to tell.
[27:19] Ok?
[27:20] It's hard to see that fully
in this moment.
[27:23] In your perfect future.
am I in it?
[27:28] Yes.
[27:31] True.
[27:33] It's funny how the answers
don't coincide.
[27:35] You wanna elaborate on that?
[27:36] In a perfect future, I'm in it.
[27:38] Yet I still hold you back.
[27:39] So your perfect future,
I'm holding you back?
[27:41] I feel like you’d have to show me
how it is to, you know, date again.
[27:44] And what that would look like.
[27:47] We're getting some
interesting answers over here.
[27:49] You have her hooked up.
Anything you wanna know about her?
[27:51] Are you gonna unchain yourself?
[27:56] No.
[28:02] True.
[28:04] Did you stop loving me?
[28:10] No.
[28:16] True.
[28:17] Josh is taking full advantage
of this moment!
[28:19] Boom!
[28:20] Alright, maybe we un-hook her.
Josh is--
[28:22] Yeah he’s grilling me!
[28:25] Alright, now you guys have a lot of things
you need to discuss.
[28:29] Oh, gosh.
[28:29] I'll see you tomorrow
to shrink the chain.
[28:31] The lie detector was pretty crazy.
[28:33] I think the one that I was like, “What?”
[28:35] was the one that you said yes to
with taking the money.
[28:38] I mean, it's just an honest thing.
[28:41] Like, Suzie already won
like 200 grand.
[28:43] So what? I'm still in here
putting in the same amount.
[28:47] No, I know.
It's just a thought, like take it.
[28:48] Let's get outta here quicker.
[28:50] Today, we were given a gift.
[28:52] I could literally leave this room
with all the money.
[28:56] She broke up with me
in the first place.
[28:58] That’d be the perfect revenge story!
[29:00] Hi! It’s day 26!
[29:02] - Bro.
- Hi!
[29:03] - A 4-foot chain?
- 4-foot chain!
[29:05] We actually have
another surprise for you.
[29:06] Oh.
[29:07] Oh wow. What is this?
[29:09] This is a soundproof box.
[29:10] You guys are gonna be able to talk
and say how you really feel.
[29:13] And the other person
will not be able to hear you.
[29:14] Josh, let's have you go first.
[29:16] Oh, alright.
Should I pull the chain?
[29:19] Bro! Josh?
[29:22] Ok!
[29:23] After last night Suzie,
how are you feeling?
[29:24] It was tough in a way.
[29:25] When he said that he would
take the money
[29:28] if he had hard feelings
about the relationship
[29:30] and the whole breakup still,
[29:32] maybe he wants revenge
in some way.
[29:33] Something else that
I've been thinking about
[29:35] has been the option
to take my cuff off right now.
[29:38] He was quick to say,
yeah, he would take it
[29:40] as if he deserves it more
or something.
[29:42] Alright, Suzie, your turn.
[29:43] - Bye!
- Bye, bye [unintelligible]
[29:45] We are only a few days out
from the end of this challenge,
[29:48] and Josh still hasn't told me
this big secret
[29:50] that he's been talking about.
[29:51] You don't plan on walking outta here
with 250 grand?
[29:53] It's a good question.
[29:56] Josh might literally steal
the entire $250,000 prize pool.
[30:00] Well if he does,
[30:01] Current would be the perfect place
to deposit all that money!
[30:03] I could live without working
for 2 years, 3 years.
[30:06] Nolan, would you like the ability
to get up to $750
[30:09] of your next paycheck
in advance?
[30:10] - Yes.
- Then you should download Current!
[30:12] Do you want help
building your credit score?
[30:13] - Yes.
- Then you should download Current!
[30:15] I'm downloading it, Jimmy.
[30:15] If you use this QR code or
the link in description: Current.com/beast
[30:19] and download Current right now,
[30:20] I will personally deposit $1
into your banking account.
[30:23] I wish I could just keep doing that.
[30:25] I've already given away hundreds
of thousands of dollars through Current
[30:28] over the last 4 years.
[30:29] Current can help you
with all your money needs.
[30:31] It's the #1 banking app
for your paycheck.
[30:34] It's probably what I will do.
[30:35] Get this, if Josh steals the prize pool
[30:37] and you guys download Current
and use code Beast,
[30:39] you will technically make more money
off this video than Suzie will,
[30:42] and you didn't have to spend
30 days in a room.
[30:45] So download Current right now,
there's never been a better time.
[30:47] I'll send you $1 right now.
[30:48] Download Current
and I will pay you to do it!
[30:51] It's the best place
for your paycheck.
[30:53] Alright guys, we're gonna leave
this box in here
[30:55] for a little bit of privacy
while we're gone.
[30:57] Bye guys, we’ll see you tomorrow.
[30:58] - Oh no.
- Alright.
[30:59] The short chain was clearly
getting to them,
[31:02] as both of them had a lot
on their mind.
[31:04] I'm really trying to be patient.
[31:06] Suzanne, you’re slow,
and it pisses me off sometimes.
[31:09] I am a little bit annoyed right now.
[31:11] Josh keeps making me
do the activity he wants to do
[31:14] by literally picking me up
and dragging me there.
[31:17] This isn't very nice.
[31:19] Good morning! Day 27.
[31:21] - From 4 feet--
- To 3 feet!
[31:23] The fact that I can’t do anything in here
[31:25] without Josh literally hovering over me
at all times is driving me crazy.
[31:30] Oh my God! Josh!
[31:32] Stop that!
Josh, let me out!
[31:35] Why are we in the kitchen?
[31:36] - Are you done?
- I am now!
[31:38] - This man--
- I need water!
[31:39] Are you serious?
[31:41] I’m sorry.
[31:42] I just needed something to drink!
[31:44] So annoying, bro.
[31:48] Day 28!
[31:51] Ooh what?
That's so short!
[31:54] Let me tell you right now,
this 2 feet is tough to deal with.
[31:57] A little bump in the kitchen used to be,
"Oh sorry, my bad."
[32:01] And now it's like every single little bump
makes me wanna leave.
[32:04] I just wanna get out of here.
[32:05] That has nothing to do with
what we were saying anyway.
[32:07] I could just leave!
[32:08] Josh today randomly brought up
this thing where he said,
[32:12] "Oh, I can just leave at any time."
[32:14] He kind of made me a little concerned that
he's just gonna walk out at any point.
[32:17] 24 hours remain!
How you doing?!
[32:19] - Let’s go!
- Woo!
[32:20] Yay!
[32:21] What's life been like
with the short chain?
[32:23] Pretty rough.
[32:24] Yeah, sleep was awful last night.
[32:26] Before we shrink down to a foot…
[32:28] Josh, I don't know if
this is the time to tell Suzie,
[32:31] if there's something
you wanna bring up?
[32:33] One thing in particular
I had to sell…
[32:38] Tell me!
[32:39] Ok, so the last 8 months of us dating…
[32:44] Ok.
[32:45] I was saving for an engagement ring,
that I ended up buying.
[32:50] But my plan was on your family vacation,
I was gonna propose under the waterfall.
[32:58] Are you serious?
[33:00] And we broke up
before that happened.
[33:04] That makes me wanna cry.
[33:05] When we broke up, I sold the ring
and I bought a motorcycle.
[33:09] Oh! [laughs]
[33:11] I actually don't know what to say.
You had an engagement ring for me?
[33:15] Yeah.
[33:16] I'm sorry.
[33:17] It's ok.
[33:18] I mean, he got a motorcycle out of it.
[33:19] I got a motorcycle out of it. Exactly.
[33:21] Oh my God.
[33:22] This is a 1-foot chain.
[33:24] - And lastly…
- Oh let's go!
[33:26] This is exactly how much time
you have left.
[33:29] Yay!
[33:30] Well, have fun.
[33:32] Bye.
[33:32] It has been a day today.
[33:34] I finally found out
the secret from Josh.
[33:36] It was that he had an engagement ring
sitting there waiting for me at home!
[33:42] Now I know that his heart was
in the right place the whole time.
[33:45] I do see that future with Josh again.
[33:48] Alright, let's sleep
by the money tonight, shall we?
[33:51] Waah! Nice!
[33:52] 12 hours and 43 minutes.
How does it make you feel?
[33:55] I think overall, the experience
has been amazing.
[34:00] I’m probably more so dying
to get out of here.
[34:05] I am scared for the next 24 hours.
[34:07] On the lie detector he asked me if
I would take my cuff off early,
[34:10] and I said no.
[34:11] True.
[34:12] But I never got that
true answer from him.
[34:13] So I have been scared the last few days
that he might actually take his cuff off.
[34:18] Am I gonna take my cuff off?
[34:19] Well, it is a lot of money.
[34:21] $250,000 would be more so life changing
than say half of that.
[34:27] When we broke up for a very long time,
I felt very lost and alone.
[34:32] I think it'd be fair for me
to take the money from her.
[34:36] We have the best view
in the world tonight!
[34:38] Our countdown clock.
[34:40] So if we get a full
12 hours of sleep,
[34:43] we'll wake up with 17 minutes
until Jimmy arrives.
[34:47] - You know what I've been thinking about?
- What?
[34:48] Remember like 3 years ago
when you broke up with me?
[34:52] Yes.
[34:52] And we like didn't talk
for 3 years…
[34:54] Mhm.
[34:57] Because I could literally just
take all the money
[34:59] and then we wouldn't talk
ever again.
[35:02] Bro!
[35:03] I'm just saying!
[35:05] Three seconds on the clock.
[35:09] If Josh unchains himself
before the time runs out,
[35:11] he wins the entire $250,000
and both of the Teslas.
[35:16] Ten minutes left on the timer!
Let's see if someone steals everything.
[35:20] How's it going?!
[35:21] Oh God, I’m nervous!
[35:22] It's actually time.
It feels fake.
[35:24] Suzie this could be your 125 grand,
Josh that could be your 125 grand.
[35:28] Unless, one of you
takes the handcuffs off.
[35:31] And just a reminder, this is what you said
during the lie detector.
[35:34] Do you believe that
I hold you back in any way?
[35:38] - Yes.
- True.
[35:39] Would you steal the entire $250,000?
[35:43] I don't think so.
[35:44] You reacted a little bit
to that one.
[35:46] A minute and 12 seconds.
[35:48] This is your last chance
to steal the money!
[35:50] - Are you going to?
- It’s the ultimate revenge.
[35:52] Oh my gosh.
Is Josh playing the long game?
[35:54] Stop! Are you going to?!
[35:56] 16 seconds, you sure?
[35:57] Nah, he deserves half of it.
[35:59] I might deserve all of it.
[36:01] Woah! Josh!
[36:04] Is there anything you'd wanna say to Suzie
for when this video airs?
[36:07] I never fully stopped loving you
after we broke up.
[36:10] And I carried that with me
everywhere I went.
[36:13] There was so much love left over
for her in my heart
[36:16] that I couldn't move on
and allow myself to love someone else.
[36:20] Can I take you on a real date
when we leave?
[36:24] Yeah!
[36:25] Ok. It's a date.
[36:27] Ok.
[36:29] Nah, he’s messing!
That looks like a guy who’s messing.
[36:31] I'm not gonna do it.
[36:32] 3, 2, 1…
[36:34] Time is up!
[36:37] Alright!
[36:38] I don't need that thing anymore!
You are now free.
[36:40] Oh my gosh!
[36:42] Here's your $125,000!
[36:44] Suzie, Josh, what's next
for the two of you?
[36:50] Oh!
[36:56] Oh woah!
I was not expecting that!
[36:59] Ok! Looks like they're happy now!
[37:01] I hope you guys enjoyed. Subscribe.
