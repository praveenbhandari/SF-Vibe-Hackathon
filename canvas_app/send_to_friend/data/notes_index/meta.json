Overview\n- **LangChain**  \n  - Popular framework for building **generative AI applications**.  \n  - Primarily used to create **LLM‑powered** chatbots, assistants, and other AI‑driven tools.  \n  - Emphasizes the integration of large language models (LLMs) with prompts, chains, and memory.\n\n- **LangGraph**  \n  - Introduced as a contrasting approach to LangChain.  \n  - Focuses on **graph‑based** workflows for LLM applications (details expanded later in the video).  \n\n> *Note:* The transcript only introduces LangGraph; its full capabilities are discussed later in the video.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Core Concepts of LangChain\n| Feature | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **LLM‑Powered** | Any application that relies on an LLM as its core inference engine. |\n| **Prompts** | Structured text inputs that guide the LLM’s output. |\n| **Chains** | Sequences of LLM calls or other operations that transform data step‑by‑step. |\n| **Memory** | State‑keeping across interactions (e.g., conversation history). |\n| **Agents** | Higher‑level orchestration that decides which chain or tool to invoke. |\n\n#### Example Workflow\n1. **User Input** → Prompt Template  \n2. **LLM Call** → Raw Response  \n3. **Post‑Processing** (e.g., parsing, formatting)  \n4. **Return to User**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Anticipated Differences (as highlighted in the video)\n- **Architecture**  \n  - *LangChain*: Linear or tree‑like chains of LLM calls.  \n  - *LangGraph*: Graph‑structured workflows allowing more complex branching and state management.\n\n- **Use Cases**  \n  - *LangChain*: Quick prototyping of chatbots, simple assistants.  \n  - *LangGraph*: Applications requiring intricate decision trees, multi‑step reasoning, or dynamic routing.\n\n- **Extensibility**  \n  - *LangChain*: Extends via custom chains and tools.  \n  - *LangGraph*: Extends via graph nodes and edges, potentially enabling richer inter‑node communication.\n\n> *Caveat:*"

Retrieve  \n- **Purpose**: Pull relevant context from a knowledge base.  \n- **Typical steps**  \n  1. **Data injection** – ingest raw data into a vector store.  \n  2. **Vectorization** – embed documents into high‑dimensional space.  \n  3. **Querying** – find nearest vectors to the user prompt.  \n\n### 2. Summarize  \n- **Purpose**: Condense retrieved context into a concise form that the LLM can use efficiently.  \n- **Common pattern**  \n  - Pass the retrieved snippets to a summarization prompt.  \n  - Optionally chain multiple summarizers for hierarchical summarization.  \n\n### 3. Output (Final Answer)  \n- **Purpose**: Generate the user‑facing response.  \n- **Typical steps**  \n  1. Combine the summary with the original prompt.  \n  2. Send to the LLM for generation.  \n  3. Post‑process (e.g., formatting, safety filtering).  \n\n---\n\n## Data Injection\n\n| Step | What it is | Typical sources | Common tools |\n|------|------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| **Load** | Read raw data | PDF, Excel, CSV, database rows, web pages | `PyPDF2`, `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `requests` |\n| **Clean** | Remove noise, normalize | Text extraction, HTML parsing | `BeautifulSoup`, `re` |\n| **Chunk** | Split into manageable pieces | Paragraphs, sentences, fixed‑size chunks | `langchain.text_splitter` |\n| **Embed** | Convert to vectors | Sentence embeddings | `OpenAIEmbeddings`, `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` |\n| **Store** | Persist vectors | FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma | `langchain.vectorstores` |\n\n### Example: Ingest a PDF into FAISS\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\n\n# 1.

The MCP server provides the necessary tools and information to the client.\n3. The Large Language Model (LLM) makes a decision based on the input.\n4. The LLM sends the input to the MCP server to get a response.\n\n### Creating an MCP Server from Scratch\n\nWe will use the LangChain library, which includes the LangChain Adapters library.\n\n### Creating an MCP Client\n\nWe will create an MCP client to communicate with the MCP server.\n\n### Transport Protocols\n\nWe will discuss the following transport protocols:\n\n* Std IO\n* HTTP protocol\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n* LangChain library\n* LangChain Adapters library\n* MCP client\n* MCP server\n* Large Language Model (LLM)\n* Std IO transport protocol\n* HTTP transport protocol\n\n### Code Snippets\n\n```python\n# Importing LangChain library\nimport langchain\n\n# Creating an MCP server using LangChain Adapters\nmcp_server = langchain.adapters.MCPAdapter()\n```\n\n```python\n# Creating an MCP client using Std IO transport protocol\nmcp_client = langchain.adapters.StdIOAdapter()\n```\n\n```python\n# Creating an MCP client using HTTP transport protocol\nmcp_client = langchain.adapters.HTTPAdapter()\n```\n\n### Next Steps\n\nWe will explore the differences between Std IO and HTTP transport protocols and implement them in code."

It consists of:\n\n* **Request**: a message sent by the client to the server to request a specific resource.\n* **Response**: a message sent by the server to the client containing the requested resource.\n\n### MCP Server Development\n\nTo develop an MCP server, we need to:\n\n1. **Define the tools**: create a list of available tools that the MCP server can execute.\n2. **Create the tools**: define each tool as a function that takes input parameters and returns output.\n3. **Implement the transport layer**: choose a transport layer (e.g., STDIO, TCP/IP) to enable communication between the MCP server and the client.\n\n### Example Code: Defining Tools\n\n```python\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers\"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\ndef multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Return the product of two numbers\"\"\"\n    return a * b\n```\n\n### Example Code: Running the MCP Server\n\n```python\nimport mcp\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mcp.run(\n        transport=\"stdio\"\n    )\n```\n\n### Understanding the Transport Layer\n\nThe transport layer is responsible for data transmission and reception between the MCP server and the client. In this example, we are using the STDIO transport layer, which allows the MCP server to communicate with the client using standard input/output streams.\n\n### Running the MCP Server\n\nTo run the MCP server, we need to execute the `mcp.run()` function, passing the transport layer as an argument. This will start the MCP server, and it will be ready to receive requests from the client."

The client is developed using the MCP client, and the server provides necessary tools and information. The Large Language Model (LLM) makes decisions based on the input and passes it to the MCP server to get a response.\n\n### Communication Flow\n\n1. Input is received by the MCP server.\n2. The MCP server provides necessary tools and information.\n3. The LLM makes a decision based on the input.\n4. The LLM passes the input to the MCP server to get a response.\n\n### Creating an MCP Server from Scratch\n\nWe will use the `langchain` library, which includes `langchain adapters`. This library will be used to create the MCP server.\n\n### Creating an MCP Client\n\nWe will also create an MCP client to communicate with the MCP server.\n\n### Transport Protocols\n\nWe will discuss and use the following transport protocols:\n\n* `std IO` (Standard Input/Output)\n* `HTTP` (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n* `langchain` library\n* `langchain adapters`\n* `std IO` protocol\n* `HTTP` protocol\n\n### Next Steps\n\nWe will explore the differences between `std IO` and `HTTP` protocols and learn how to use them from a coding perspective.\n\n### Example Code (MCP Server using langchain)\n\n```python\nimport langchain\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\n\n# Create an LLMChain instance\nllm_chain = LLMChain(\n    llm=\"text-davinci-003\",\n    chain=\"text-davinci-003\",\n    max_length=2048,\n)\n\n# Create an MCP server using langchain adapters\nmcp_server = langchain.adapters.MCPAdapter(llm_chain)\n```\n\n### Example Code (MCP Client using std IO)\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Create an MCP client using std IO\nmcp_client = langchain.adapters.MCPClient(sys.stdin, sys.stdout)\n```"

Open the MCP demo language folder.\n2. Create a new folder for the project.\n3. Initialize the workspace using the `uv` package:\n```bash\nuv init\n```\nThis will create a new `uv` workspace with the necessary files.\n\n### Creating an Environment\n\n1. Create a new file called `requirements.txt` to specify the dependencies for the project.\n2. Install the dependencies using `uv`:\n```bash\nuv install -r requirements.txt\n```\nThis will install the necessary packages for the project.\n\n### Creating an HTTP Server\n\n1. Import the `http` module in Python:\n```python\nimport http.server\n```\n2. Create a new class that inherits from `http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler`:\n```python\nclass MCPRequestHandler(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        # Handle GET requests\n        pass\n\n    def do_POST(self):\n        # Handle POST requests\n        pass\n```\n3. Create an instance of the `http.server.HTTPServer` class:\n```python\nserver_address = ('', 8000)\nhttpd = http.server.HTTPServer(server_address, MCPRequestHandler)\n```\n4. Start the server:\n```python\nhttpd.serve_forever()\n```\nThis will start the HTTP server on port 8000.\n\n### Creating an HTTP/1.1 Server\n\n1. Import the `http.server` module in Python:\n```python\nimport http.server\n```\n2. Create a new class that inherits from `http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler`:\n```python\nclass MCPRequestHandler(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        # Handle GET requests\n        pass\n\n    def do_POST(self):\n        # Handle POST requests\n        pass\n```\n3. Create an instance of the `http.server.HTTPServer` class:\n```python\nserver_address = ('', 8001)\nhttpd = http.server.HTTPServer(server_address, MCPRequestHandler)\n```\n4. Set the `server_version` attribute to `'HTTP/1.1'`:\n```python\nhttpd.server_version = 'HTTP/1.1'\n```\n5.

    "text": "## New Lecture Notes: Setting Up MCP Server Project\n\n### Definition of MCP Server\n\nMCP Server is a project that allows users to create and run custom tools using a simple command-line interface.\n\n### Defining Tools in MCP Server\n\nTo define a tool in MCP Server, we need to create a function with a specific signature. The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of type `int`. The function should also return the result of the operation in the form of an integer.\n\n```python\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Adds two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n```\n\n### Defining the `multiply` Tool\n\nWe can define another tool called `multiply` using the same syntax.\n\n```python\ndef multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Multiplies two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (int): The first number.\n        b (int): The second number.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The product of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a * b\n```\n\n### Understanding the HTD IO Transport\n\nThe HTD IO transport is a way to interact with the MCP Server. It allows us to send input to the server and receive output from it. We can use the `stdio` transport to interact with the server using the standard input/output streams.\n\n### Running the MCP Server Application\n\nTo run the MCP Server application, we need to create a `main` function that calls the `mcp.run()` method. We can use the `stdio` transport to run the application.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    mcp.run(transport=\"stdio\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n* Define tools in MCP Server using functions with specific signatures.\n* Use the `stdio` transport to interact with the MCP Server.\n* Create a `main` function to run the MCP Server application.\n* Use the `mcp.run()` method to run the application."

By the definition of ODD, n^2 is odd.\n\n### Set Operations\n\n*   **Deﬁnition**: For any two sets A and B, the complement of A \\ B is denoted by A[B and is defined as:\n    *   An element x is in A[B if and only if it is not in A \\ B (from the definition of complement).\n    *   An element x is in A[B if and only if it is neither in A nor in B (from the definition of union).\n    *   An element x is in A[B if and only if it is in A and x is in B (from the definition of intersection).\n    *   Therefore, A[B = A \\ B.\n\n### Contrapositive\n\n*   **Deﬁnition**: The contrapositive of a statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p\".\n*   **Example**: If n is an integer and 3n + 2 is odd, then n is odd.\n*   **Proof**: Suppose n is even, then n = 2k, 3n + 2 = 6k + 2 = 2(3k + 1), which is even.\n\n### Proof by Induction\n\n*   **Deﬁnition**: Proof by induction is a proof technique that allows us to prove a certain fact P(n) holds for all n, by showing the following two facts:\n    *   P(1) is true.\n    *   For every k, if P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) is true.\n*   **Example**: Show that 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2.\n*   **Proof**:\n    1.  Let P(n) denote 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2.\n    2.  We need to show that P(1), P(2), P(3), ... are all true.\n    3.  We cannot show each of them individually.\n    4.  We will show that P(k) is true for some k, and then show that P(k + 1) is true using the fact that P(k) is true.\n\n### Code Snippet (None provided)"

We need to show that P(n) is true for all n.\n\n### Step 1: Prove the base case\n\nBase case: Show that P(1) is true.\nTo show P(1) is true, we need to show that 1 = 1(1+1)/2.\nSince both L.H.S and R.H.S are equivalent, we have proved the statement.\n\n### Step 2: Write down the induction hypothesis\n\nP(k): 1 + 2 + ···+k = k(k+1)/2.\nThis will be assumed to be true.\n\n### Step 3: Prove the induction step\n\nAssuming P(k) is true, we need to show that P(k+1) is true.\nTo show P(k+1) is true, we need to show that 1 + 2 + ···+k+1 = (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\nThink how you can use the P(k) here.\nAlternative, how can you reduce the statement involving k+1 to one involving k.\n\nFor instance, the L.H.S of P(k+1) can be written as (1 + 2 + 3 + ···+k)+k+1.\nThe L.H.S of P(k) matches with the first part of the L.H.S of P(k+1).\nHence, you can replace (1 + 2 + 3 + ···+k) with k(k+1)/2.\n\nNow, L.H.S of P(k+1), namely, (1 + 2 + 3 + ···+k)+k+1 is equal to k(k+1)/2 + k+1 = (k+1)(k/2 + 1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2, which is the required R.H.S for P(k+1).\n\n### Example: Power Set of A\n\nShow that the number of elements in the power set of A is 2^n.\n\n### Step 0: Write the statement in the form of P(n)\n\nLet P(n) denote the number of elements in the power set of A is 2^n. We need to show that P(n) is true for all n.\n\n### Step 1: Prove the base case\n\nBase case: Show that P(0) is true.\nSince the power set of the empty set is the empty set itself, which has 1 element, P(0) is true.\n\n### Step 2: Write down the induction hypothesis\n\nP(k): the number of elements in the power set of A is 2^k.\nThis will be assumed to be true.\n\n### Step 3: Prove the induction"
